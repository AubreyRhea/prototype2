ATX GIS day will take place followed by Austin Geo Bash!

Takes place on Tuesday December 12th, and you're invited to take part in the festivities. This is the Austin geo-community's annual holiday happy hour and charity drive: Geo Bash is for anyone and everyone in (or near!) Austin who works with, loves, or is learning about all things GEOSPATIAL.

This year's Geo Bash will be located at [BD Riley's on 6th Street](https://bdrileys.com/sixthstreet/), following [ATX GIS Day](http://atxgisday.org/) activities.

Attending Geo Bash is FREE, but as always, we encourage attendees to bring a donation for one or both of [SafePlace](http://www.safeaustin.org/get-involved/give/donate/) and the [Central Texas Food Bank](https://www.centraltexasfoodbank.org/get-involved/donate). We will be collecting monetary donations for both organizations.

All geo-people and their guests are welcome: there will be plenty of geofood, geofun and geofriends, so join us!

**[RSVP here](https://austingeobash2017.splashthat.com/)**
